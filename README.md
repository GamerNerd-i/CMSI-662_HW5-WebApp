# CMSI-662: Secure Web Application

## Bank of Aiur

This simple bank app demonstrating secure web application practices is themed after the highly advanced Protoss alien race from Blizzard Entertainment's *StarCraft* franchise. The terminology may take a little getting used to, but with a little effort it's easy to identify many of the same functions as a typical Terran (human) bank. Rest assured that your minerals are safe with us!

Compared to the original example from the notes, the site features a new "accounts" page, from which all the user's active accounts are viewable in a dynamically updating list. Notice that the [createAccounts](bin/createAccounts.py) script has been updated to create 3 additional accounts for Alice. (There's no way to create or delete accounts within the app, though.)
